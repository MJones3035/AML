## Context and problem 
What is the correct choice of database system for the scope of the project?

## Considered Options
*  MariaDB
* SQLite
* PostgreSQL

## Decision Outcome
MariaDB
https://mariadb.org/


## Reason of choice
The nature of the advanced media library system would suit this database system due to the ease of use because of the MyPHPAdmin interface as well as it being familiar.
 A more performant and scalable system than this is not necessary with the scope of the current project and proof of concept.

## Pros
*  Has a user friendly interface via MyPHPAdmin
* Is vertically scalable, requiring less servers
* Familiarity

## Cons
* Lacks debugging tools due it being community supported
	
## Other Choice
SQLite
https://www.sqlite.org/

## Pros
* Small languages features, so less complexity 
* Fast performance as it is lightweight

## Cons
* Not scalable, designed for small databases
* May lack desired functions due to it having few features

## Other Choice
 PostgreSQL
https://www.postgresql.org/

## Pros
*  A Lot of features, has a JSON data type
* Is more performant overall than MariaDB

## Cons
* Hard to implement

## Other Choice
 MySQL
https://www.mysql.com/

## Pros

## Cons
* Less features than MariaDB

## Context and problem
AML requires a robust and scalable system, this requires a backend that would be suitable with further development, 
contains an ecosystem that is well maintained and documented to allow for development.

## Considered Options
* PHP (with HTML, CSS, JS and bootstrap)
* Python with Django
* Laravel

## Decision Outcome
 PHP (with HTML, CSS, JS and bootstrap)

## Pros
* Familiarity with PHP allows for rapid development therefore quicker turnout for the proof of concept
* PHP is well established on multiple websites showcasing its scalability.

## Cons
* Lack of debugging tools makes certain issues hard to solve

##Other Choice
NodeJS + React

## Pros
* NodeJS and React are inherently good for scalability with Node having vertical and horizontal scaling while Reacts components allows for reusability further improving 
* Lack of knowledge of these frameworks will make a proof of concept and development very difficult
## Cons

## Other Choice
Python with Django

## Pros 
* Is based on the the MVC architecture creating structure within the system that allows for cleaner, reusable code
* The steep learning curve makes it difficult for us to work with.

## Other Choice
Laravel

## Pros
* MVC architecture so is scalable and easy to test
* Has built in framework features like security

## Cons
* You have to learn how to work with the framework and so a steeper learning curve
